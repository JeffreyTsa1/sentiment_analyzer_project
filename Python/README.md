=======
Ling 406 Final Project
NetID: Jeffrey5
SP19

This is the readme file for this project. The project is built on python3.7.3

This python3 file operates like a normal python file. Once in the correct source folder, type "python3 postagging.py" to run the script.


=======

Run "python3 classifier.py" on a terminal whilst in the "Python" directory. 

Users can type Y/N to choose whether they want specific features


The analyzer currently only runs with 500 pieces of data. This is to save time and processing power since my computer is not very capable. This can easily be changed by modifying the numbers in the code.

The analyzer also calculates runtime after each algorithm, I tried saving a bit of time with pre-processing on the last two ML classifiers, since they're both imported from SKLearn.

======

To run the yelp classifier, navigate into the yelp_reviews folder and run "python3 yelp_classifier.py"

This works the same way as the original classifier as users can choose the specific features they want.
